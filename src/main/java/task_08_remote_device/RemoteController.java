/**
 * 8*. Write a project named ""Remote Device"".
 * Create a class ""RemoteController" which will be simulation the real one to control the TV.
 * Create interfaces Device and Volume.
 * The ""Device"" interface should have methods powerOn(), powerOff(), setChannel(int channel),
 * and currentChannel();
 * The ""Volume"" interface should have methods ""upVolume(), downVolume() and mute();
 * Write an abstract class TVDevice which will be implementing interfaces Volume and Device and
 * has the fields String modelName and boolean isOn (Tip: You don't need to implement methods from the interface
 * if you class is abstract).
 * Write a class ""TV"" which extends the class TVDevice. Implements all the methods.
 * Write a class RemoteController to control your TV.
 * Example of the structure in the requirements.
